********************   Data types In javaScript ***************************

    Javascript is weekly  type language because 
        1. JavaScript is a dynamic language with dynamic types.
        2.Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values

        E.g let foo = 42; // foo is now a number
        foo = "bar"; // foo is now a string
        foo = true; // foo is now a boolean

        3. which means it allows implicit type conversion when an operation involves mismatched types, instead of throwing type errors.

        const foo = 42; // foo is a number
        const result = foo + "1"; // JavaScript coerces foo to a string, so it can be concatenated with the other operand
        console.log(result); // 421
